# Sources

In the first instance, the Parliamentary Handbook was the main source of information. This was augmented with information from Wikipedia, the Australian Dictionary of Biography, and the Senate Biographies wherever possible. Limited information was obtained from other sources, such as state parliaments and newspapers (via Trove), and these have generally been specified in the comments. birthPlace is mostly from WikiData.

The uniqueID_to_aphID dataset was primarily drawn from a dataset put together by Patrick Leslie, and it was checked against a modern dataset from Open Australia, and Tim Sherrattâ€™s Historic Hansard records for the Reps and Senate.

I'd recommend using the datasets as they are provided in the AustralianPoliticians package and repo - https://github.com/RohanAlexander/AustralianPoliticians - and if you do that please additionally cite the package.

# TODO

1. Karen Grogan needs a birthdate or at least a year - will need to update the uniqueID at that point too.
2. Greg Mirabella likely soon in the Senate replacing Scott Ryan.
