    Additional Information
Publications- Publication of Churchill Fellowship Findings and Report To investigate how public education systems of government in Singapore and Finland develop and prepare leaders for contexts of increased autonomy, decision making, accountability and how these governments manage the challenges of continued vertical fiscal imbalances. Despite these imbalances Singapore and Finland lead the world in education. The study of autonomous local innovation in schools, the leadership skills, abilities and behaviours of the school leaders in these systems is timely in the Australian context to ensure that Queensland and Australia is competitive in a globalised world.
