    Notes: He joined the Australian Workers Union in 1902. In 1918 he joined the ALP and acquired a reputation a a soapbox orator who spoke on topics, usually involving political theory, economics and rationalism, in great detail and with utmost seriousness. In 1919, Mr Taylor was a participant in the 'Merivale Street riots' in which returned soldiers clashed with Russians and trade unionists. He was one of 15 charged under the War Precautions Act for publicly displaying a red flag at the 'International Socialist' march in contravention of a prohibition made by the then Minister for Defence. His conviction was appealed to the Supreme Court where he was represented by Premier TJ Ryan. The court found for the Commonwealth but on the same day all the prisioners were released under a general amnesty granted to mark the official declaration of peace. His appeal was the beginning of a close friendship with Mr Ryan, which was instrumental in Taylor securing a position in the Public Service as a clerk in the Tourist Bureau. This appointment provided the foundation for his subsequent political career as through the 1920s it provided him with the security to devote more time to politics. President, Australian-Russian Association of Queensland incorporating Medical Aid to Russia Committee; President, Returned Soldiers Labour League; Freemason. On 5 Sep 1941, the Queensland Central Executive ruled that party members might not be members of, or participate in activities of, the Australian-Russian Medical Aid to Soviet Russia Assocation in Queensland. Taylor was the president of the association and GH Marriott (member for Bulimba) was its vice-president. Taylor publicly referred to the QCE decision as 'stupid', claiming the association 'was nothing more than a humanitarian body, striving to bring medical aid to a country fighting nobly against the Germans'. He was expelled by the Executive on 29 Oct 1941. At the 1941 election Mr Taylor stood in the seat of Enoggera as an 'Independent Enoggera Labor' candidate. He stood with GH Marriott on an 'Aid to Russia' ticket.

            Additional Information
    Notes: In 1874, Thorn was a Queensland delegate to the International Conference on Overseas Cables in Sydney; Thorn became Premier on 5 June 1876 after Arthur Macalister resigned to take up an appointment as Agent-General in London. He found it difficult to lead the colony as a member of the Legislative Council, so he resigned on 13 June 1876 and on 23 June 1876 won the seat of Ipswich; Thorn resigned as Premier on 8 March 1877 but continued as Secretary for Public Works and Mines under John Douglas's leadership. During Thorn's period as Premier, his ministry was not taken seriously because Samuel Griffith was seen as the power behind the throne. Six days after marrying Celia at Ellengowan (now Augathella) on 14 February 1878, Thorn resigned his seat of Ipswich and spent the rest of the year travelling in Europe and represented Queensland at the Paris Universal Exhibition. In 1900, Thorn was a member of the Royal Commission into Liquor Traffic

            Additional Information
    Notes: Interests included motoring and orchid culture. Sir John arrived penniless in Queensland in 1907 as an assisted migrant. President, Electrical Federation, Queensland branch, 1928-1929. Founder, Queensland Anti-Communist Freedom League, 1949. President, Brisbane Chamber of Commerce; Queensland Patriotic and Australian Comforts Fund during WWII; and Australian Federation of Broadcasting Stations. Patron, Queensland Orchid Society; Member, Rotary Club of Brisbane; and Young Men's Christian Association. Sir John founded the Queensland People's Party and was its leader from 26 Oct 1943 to 7 Mar 1946. The Queensland People's Party later became the Queensland division of the Liberal Party. As Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Sir John was entitled to be paid however he decided not to take the salary but put it back into the city coffers. One of the greatest and most lasting monuments to Sir John is Gympie Road, Chermside. Abuse was levelled at Sir John by the ratepayers when he first suggested there should be a four-lane highway at the entrance to the city and the necessary resumptions were made.  Sir John's funeral was held on 22 Jan 1962 at St John's Cathedral.  The Brisbane suburb of Chandler was named in his honour. As he built and operated Brisbane's first commercial broadcasting station, 4BC, the 'BC' stands for Beals Chandler

    Notes: In 1874 and 1876 he proposed bills to establish a statutory eight-hour day. Neither bill was passed by the Assembly. Postmaster General in Sir Thomas McIlwraith's first ministry. He was in that office for two years. During that time the post and telegraph departments became one and the telephone was introduced; Buzacott was a strong advocate for a direct mail service to London. It is said that he was the author of the Divisional Boards Act which was to become the foundation of the local government legislation in Queensland. Buzacott was a fearless reporter and a strong critic of Hansard. He told a government committee that `if the House wishes Hansard read, it must make Hansard readable'. His comments resulted in the government taking action against the publisher of the Brisbane Courier, which was unsuccessful

    Notes: Interests included gardening and surfing. In one of his first sittings as Chairman of Committees, an air raid siren sounded an alert. Brassington ordered an exodus to the shelters. Members and staff emerged 40 minutes later from the catacombs when it was determined that the siren was a false alarm. It was under Brassington's Speakership that Mr JF Barnes was suspended (one of many times) from the House. On this occasion he refused to leave the parliamentary precinct. Mr Brassington ordered two detectives to evict him from the premises. Towards the end of his career, the parliament's standing orders were extensively changed. One of the changes was the introduction of Standing Order 123A, which allowed the Speaker to order the withdrawal of a disorderly member. Previously the only punishment available was the suspension of the member from the House. It was felt a lesser punishment was required

      Additional Information
    Notes: He took a leading role in the agitation for separation and fought against the renewal of convict transportation.  He won a by-election in January 1861 to represent West Moreton in the first Queensland parliament. He was disqualified from this first election as he held an office of profit under the Crown, being the coroner in Ipswich. He was re-elected in a by-election in June 1861. He was an outspoken member of the parliament. He advocated a just land policy which would give opportunity to the small settler, efficient agriculture, free secular education, political equality, religious tolerance and railway construction free from scandal of land grants. He opposed the cotton bonus and the aggregation of pastoral land by wealthy companies.  He was the archetype of what is now called a `do-gooder'. He had a social conscience and was recognised for his real virtues of tolerance and liberalism

Mr Smyth was one of 13 MPs and former MPs the Courier-Mail named as having been adversely referred to in the Criminal Justice Commission report over their travel allowances.  Mr Smyth was one of the MPs who refunded money claimed. The CJC was asked to investigate allegations that two people from a state ALP branch office tried to bribe an independent electoral candidate. The allegation concerned authorised how-to-vote cards which recommended suporters give their second preference votes to the ALP candidate, Mr Ken Smyth. Mr Smyth unsuccessfully contested the seat of Charters Towers on 19 September 1992 after his seat of Bowen was redistributed

            Additional Information
    Notes: Interests include good music and active in singing and eisteddfod circles. State councillor and delegate, Australian Railways Union and secretary of the Conclurry branch. Patron, Townsville Trades and Labor Council. President, Choral and Orchestral Society. Because of his left-wing politics, Aikens was expelled from the Hermit Park branch of the ALP in 1940. On 8 Oct 1941, the Queensland Central Executive of the ALP unanimously adopted the decision that no member of the ALP could become, or continue to be, a member of the Australia-Soviet Friendship League or other kindred organisation. In 1941, when the Medical Aid to Russia Committee was formed, the Hermit Park branch affiliated with the committee. The Queensland Central Executive demanded that the branch withdraw its affiliation. The Hermit Park branch refused to do so and was expelled from the ALP. The ousted branch formed itself into a new party, the North Queensland Labor Party, in 1942 and Aikens was invited to return to membership, which he did. In 1944 Aikens commenced his 33 years as an Independent when he was elected for the seat of Mundingburra. He became known as the `Voice of the North'. On 31 Oct 1944, the then Minister for Transport, Mr EJ Walsh, and Aikens engaged in fisticuffs in the lobby of the Legislative Assembly. Walsh had goaded Aikens for weeks after a bitterly fought election campaign in which Aikens won the seat of Mundingburra from Labor. Immediately after Walsh tendered his apology to the House for the incident that had occurred

            Additional Information
Tarnya is the Member for Mount Ommaney in Brisbane’s South-West and the Shadow Minister for Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander and Multicultural Affairs in the Queensland Opposition.

Tarnya was born and raised in Sydney, before moving to regional New South Wales with her family in her early teens.  Tarnya grew up watching her parents’ work hard operating their own family business within the meat industry. This experience helped develop a strong work ethic that Tarnya consistently demonstrates. 

Tarnya moved to Queensland to further her career in Industrial Relations, having previously worked overseas at Harrod’s and then later at Heathrow Airport as a Manager of the Duty free Stores.  While working as an industrial relations adviser, Tarnya gained formal qualifications in human resources and industrial relations through Griffith University. 

In 2004 Tarnya and her husband Steve, established their own business, which eventually became a unique, award winning butcher shop that serviced Brisbane’s South-Western Suburbs.

Motivated by the challenges her community faced, Tarnya decided to run for state parliament, and since her election in 2012 continues to be an enthusiastic advocate for her community.

Tarnya is a hard worker, and works diligently for her local community. Tarnya’s top five recent local achievements include:
•reopening public palliative care beds at Canossa Hospital and the establishment of a new palliative care hub at Corinda

•increased financial support for local schools, sporting and community groups

•the installation of flashing school zone safety lights at many local schools

•improving local frontline services including the delivery of two new ambulances, reductions in dental and surgery waiting lists, and additional frontline police on the beat, and

•Advocating, and delivering a historic cut of 5% in public transport fares


Tarnya says “One of the key lessons I have learnt in my working life is the importance of building good relationships”. 

“I will continue to work hard to represent the people of Mount Ommaney and keep achieving positive outcomes for our local community and for Queensland.”

Tarnya lives in Westlake with her husband, Steve, and their children, and is an active member of her community.

    Notes: Interests included cricket, golf and fishing. President, Australian Sugar Producers Association. Member: Isis Golf Club; and Cordalba Racing Club. Chairman, Isis Canegrowers Executive. Director, Isis Central Sugar Mill Ltd, 1939. Sir Alfred was a vigorous debater and staunch advocate of all matters bearing on the welfare of primary industries and the sugar industry, in particular. One of 18 original members of the Country Party, he was the leading spirit among four party members who declined to join the short-lived merger with the UAP that formed the Country National Party in Apr 1941. In the Assembly the four sat apart from the coalition until it collapsed. A reconciliation saw the emergence of the Australian Country Party (Qld), of which Brand became Deputy Leader

He was widely respected and did much to help smaller settlers and was always ready to support worthwhile public activities. President, Queensland Club; Member, North Australian Club.

    Notes: Griffith supported legal reform and was against squatter biased legislation. He also supported immigration from Europe, more money for public works, creating rural boards and municipal government. He also argued in debates that barristers should be separate and superior to solicitors;  Griffith is noted for limiting Chinese migration, implementing free, compulsory and secular education, attempting to improve the rights of Indigenous people to give evidence and trying to establish a university in the colony; As Premier he further limited Asian migration, abolished the trade in Kanaka labour, recognised the fishing rights of Indigenous people, gave the state more control over charitable organisations, introduced probation for first-time offenders and opposed separatist movements; Following the recession of 1886, he started to support the labour movement. He then proceeded to legalise trade unions.  He introduced a bill proposing eight hour working days. Griffith is noted for codifying the criminal law in Queensland in 1899;  appointed to the Privy Council in 1901. Griffith was prominent in the early moves towards Federation and was fundamental in the drafting of the Australian Constitution

Life member: Redlands Show Society; Redlands Tourist Committee; Redlands Cricketers Club; and Redlands Agricultural, Horticultural and Industrial Society. He was sent to the Northern Territory to implement the Payne-Fletcher Report for the development of the territory. As Redland Shire Chairman, he inherited the threat of a proposed cement works at Ormiston Point. This situation was resolved when he was elected state member for Logan and he forced through the town plan. As Redland Shire Chairman, he was responsible for the building of a bridge that linked Wynnum and Cleveland, named the EGW Wood Bridge. He also preserved railway land between Cleveland and Thorneside when the steam trains were taken off and the lines removed. That decision paved the way for the electric line to be brought to the shire in the 1980s

    Notes: Baynes moved to Queensland in 1859 and joined Isaac and Hugh Moore on Barambah station in the Burnett district and on Condamine Plains on the Darling Downs. He was one of the pioneers of the meat-preserving industry and has seen the trade develop from its very beginning. He established a butchering business in South Brisbane in 1859 and expanded to wholesale trade. In 1881 he introduced a Selectors Relief Bill, which failed to pass. In 1880, with his brothers, Baynes established the Graziers Butchering Co. and the Graziers Meat Export Co. The companies were sold in 1885 to a new partnership of the three Baynes sons (Harry, George and Ernest) and George Hooper, who was replaced in 1888 by John V. Francis. The firm undertook meat preserving in leased premises at Queensport and had nearly 30 suburban shops as well as a plant at Belmont for fellmongering, wool scouring and soap making. It also operated a factory at South Brisbane to supply cooperage, saddlery and vehicles. The business seemed prosperous, but the four inexperienced partners were soon in trouble from incompetent accounting and excessive personal drawings. In 1894 they registered the Graziers Butchering and Meat Export Co. Ltd with power to take over the assets of the two older companies, which in 1897 they allowed to become insolvent. Baynes sons were bankrupt for a time but were discharged in March 1898 and immediately registered a new firm, Baynes Bros. George left the firm in 1899 and Ernest in 1912. With a new partner John Stitt, Harry reorganised the firm in 1918 as Baynes Ltd.  He had just concluded a successful business arrangement with the Netherlands-India government

    Notes: Roy Armstrong entered parliament in tragic and somewhat unusual circumstances. His election on 23 Jul 1960 was brought about by the sudden death of not one but two previous members. The sitting Country Party member for Mulgrave, Robert Watson, had died in Mar 1959. At the subsequent by-election on 6 Jun 1959, Carlisle Wordsworth was successful in winning the seat. Wordsworth served out the remainder of Robert Watson's unfinished term and nominated as the Country Party candidate for the general election that was set down for 28 May 1960. However, three weeks before the poll, Carl Wordsworth also passed away, and it was announced that a special election for the seat of Mulgrave would be held on 23 Jul 1960. That special election saw Roy Armstrong, who was a popular local cane farmer of 25 years standing, installed as the new member for Mulgrave. Roy Armstrong was regarded as a strong local member in the Far North and a strong voice for the sugar industry. Interests include bands and bowling. He was well known as a very skilful player in the pipe band, as well as a judge of pipers and Scottish dancing. Patron, North Queensland Pipe Bands Association and was a participant every year. Chairman, Innisfail Conservatorium of Music; Deputy Chairman, Board of Directors, Innisfail Conservatorium of Music, for 18 years; Member, Board of Directors Babinda Cooperative Central Mill Society, 1951 to 1953 and 1956 to 1958; Founder and first President, North Queensland Loggers Association; Chairman, Babinda Cane Pest and Disease Board; Member, Masonic Lodge, for 40 years

    Notes: When JA Bell was just a baby, his parents migrated to Australia. His father was a squatter and a convict overseer. In 1844 his father took over the pastoral lease of Jimbour Station on the Darling Downs. It was run by a manager until 1847 when the Bell family took charge, with the leasehold being registered in the name of Bell & Sons. On his father's death in 1874, Jimbour House was passed on to John Alexander's elder brother, Joshua Peter. John Alexander spent most of the 1870s and 1880s in the UK. In 1895 he resided at Merrivale Station, Mitchell

      Additional Information
    Notes: Interests included fishing and reading. Controversy entered his life when he announced his intention to remain in parliament after winning the Lord Mayoralty and to keep the salaries of both jobs. He argued that he was not denying anyone of a job because the only reason he became Labor's candidate for City Hall was that no-one else wanted it. On 21 Aug 1953, Mr Roberts (who at the time was Lord Mayor of Brisbane and MLA for Nundah) resigned from the ALP in protest against Queensland Central Executive domination. He became an Independent Labor member. He was refused readmission to the party on 20 Aug 1954 but was readmitted in 1958

      Additional Information
    Notes: As a young man he sailed to New Zealand. In 1849, after a disturbance among the crew on the vessel the captain refused to proceed so Beattie took charge and navigated the vessel to Port Phillip. For some time after he served as a pilot at Port Phillip. Later Beattie lived in Sydney. At the time of the Canoona rush he successfully sailed to Keppel Bay and later visited Brisbane. It was not until 1862 that Beattie finally settled in Brisbane, arriving on the steamer Maryborough. Beattie was a community minded man as evidenced by his involvement in the fire brigade, in the Grand United Order of Oddfellows, in local government and in politics.  He was untiring in his endeavours to serve the citizens of his area well. It is said that although his zeal may be misdirect one could never question his desire to do what he believed to be right. It is noted that even those who did not agree with his point of view when it came to the government's proposed Valley railway scheme respected the manly stance he took. He was strongly opposed to the proposal given his service as chairman of the Booroodabin Divisional Board. His views led to a strong push to unseat him from the seat of Fortitude Valley. This affected Beattie's health. When in parliament Beattie exercised an amount of influence. He was respected by those on both sides of the House

    Notes: Interests included sport of all kinds, antiques and architecture. Director, Townsville United Soccer Club. Patron, numerous Townsville soccer associations. Patron: Castle Hill Scout Association; Blue Nursing Association; and the Italo-Australian Club. Vice-patron, North Barrier Surf Life Saving Association. At the Townsville General Hospital he was renowned for his pioneering innovations and long hours of hard work. He pioneered lung surgery in Townsville in the late 1970s. He became renowned for his attacks on the Premier of the day, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, and crossed the floor on occasions to vote with the ALP opposition. It was felt that this streak of independence prevented him from ever being appointed to the ministry. He had been a successful boxer at university and in the Army. In fact, he had been a former Australian universities heavyweight champion. He even fought a few professional bouts to put himself through his studies - until his mother found out! His wife, Olive, was known to publicise the size of the potholes in Townsville streets by sitting in them and being photographed by the local newspaper. His son, Sam, represented Queensland and the Australian Wallabies in rugby union

    Notes:  Haly was one of the first to detect intestinal worms in sheep and, being aware of the dangers of overexploiting land, he advocated remedial measures. As a member of the Legislative Assembly, his subjects of interest were the preservation of indigenous grasses, the use of steam ploughs and irrigation. He supported measures to deal with stock diseases and for supplying Brisbane with water from the upper Brisbane River basin. He also secured the abolition of the salt duty

      Additional Information
    Notes: In his youth, Mr Barnes was a champion runner, footballer and rifle shot. Associate, Douglas Social Credit Movement. A failed police prosecution for selling liquor after hours launched Mr Barnes' extraordinary political career. Convinced of widespread police and political corruption, he initiated numerous successful prosecutions for breaches of the liquor laws that earned him the nickname 'the Bundaberg Bombshell'. An 'able bush-lawyer', he lost only one of 31 applications to the Supreme Court of Queensland. During his stormy political career, he was suspended from parliament eight times during the nine years he was elected. During debate on the Appropriation Bill, Mr Barnes was suspended for two weeks without pay after an extraordinary scene which was the climax to an outburt by him on the subject of an inquiry into a missing woman, Marjorie Norval (former social secretary to Mrs Forgan Smith) who he said had been 'shanghaied to California'. He was repeatedly warned and subsequently suspended. When Mr Barnes refused to reveal his source to the police on the missing woman, the government amended the Coroner's Act to make it an offence to withhold such information. After declining to name his source a second time, the coroner jailed him. In court on 1 Jun 1943 Barnes named his informants as 'Detective Smith' and 'Citizen Jones', but later conceded that he had been duped. Always dressed in a white suit and pith helmet, he was a political showman, never above stage-managing incidents to attract publicity. Humour was part of his political style: when rebuked by chairman of committees Sam Brassington in Oct 1943 for not apologising to the House 'in a decent and manly way', Barnes knelt on the floor, clasped his hands, and intoned, 'I humbly withdraw the statement'. After another suspension it was ruled that the suspension from parliament precluded Barnes from occupying a room at the country members lodge. The Speaker directed the police to evict him. In May 1946 Barnes, in the Full Court of Queensland, won his case for assault against a policeman on the grounds that the lodge was not part of Parliament House. His marriage to Miss Evelyn Buchanan of Beaudesert took place on the terrace of Parliament House. It was the first wedding to be held there. In the motion of condolence speakers referred to `Bombshell' Barnes' colourful character and unpredictable nature

The achievements Sir Joh was most proud of include the building of Wivenhoe and Burdekin dams, the Gateway Bridge, the electrification and modernisation of the Queensland rail network, the staging of the 1982 Commonwealth Games and World Expo 88 and his personal decision to abolish death duties. During the 1980s Sir Joh introduced stamp duty concessions and exemptions to small business, family property transfer, first home buyers and mortgages. To attract interstate investment and stimulate the economy, he also introduced payroll tax exemptions for small businesses and employers with apprentices. Projects such as Sanctuary Cove and Bond University owe their existence to the personal approval of Sir Joh. Racing and gaming industries also prospered under his leadership. Development plans for a casino in Townsville and on the Gold Coast were underway in 1982. Poker machines remained banned in Queensland under Joh's government

            Additional Information
    Notes: Mr Collins migrated to Maryborough in 1883 and moved to Gympie in 1887.  In 1924, Collins became a 'party room' Premier for only three hours. During a caucus meeting, members demanded Premier Theodore not only reverse his decision to reduce basic wages by five shillings but also that the working week be shortened to 44 hours. Theodore argued that the state's economy would not allow these measures. The majority insisted on immediate action. After consultation with his cabinet colleagues, Theodore announced that he and his cabinet would resign their positions. The caucus then had to elect a new leader and, to his surprise, Collins was voted `Premier elect'. After three hours of deliberation, caucus decided to ask Theordore to return to office

            Additional Information
    Notes: Interests include racing, football, cricket and tennis. In 1940 Mr Tomkins bought 'Westgrove' cattle station at Injune and in 1954 moved to 'Stuarts Creek' north of Roma where he continued a successful Hereford breeding program with members of his family. Member: United Graziers Executive Council, 1951 to 1967; and Queensland Meat Authority, 1965 to 1967. President, Maranoa Graziers Association, 1954 to 1964. There were calls from the National Party to sack Mr Tomkins after he caused international embarrassment with remarks that Aboriginals were not ready for freehold land rights because they would not know what it was. This and other comments were made in an interview for Radio New Zealand. Mr Tomkins and Mr Sullivan were both asked to resign from Cabinet but refused. The then Premier, Mr Bjelke-Petersen, attempted to sack both men. National Party backbenchers considered a plan to thwart the sackings, calling for a secret ballot. After he retired from politics, Mr Tomkins and his wife moved to Biddeston, outside Toowoomba, where they were associated with a thoroughbred stud. During his later years he owned successful racehorses including Mississippi Prince, Prince Ruling and Sovereignty

            Additional Information
    Notes: In August 1850 Walsh joined MC O'Connell, W Forster and others in punishing Aboriginals for the murder of Gregory Blaxland junior. A subsequent bitter fued led to the dismissal of native police commandant F Walker and was followed by public quarrels with Edward Deas Thomson, AG Maclean, Sir George Bowen and AE Halloran. The conflict revealed Walsh as nasty, devious and highly egocentric. He opposed the separation of Queensland and for a time refused to accept nomination to the Legislative Council or to stand for election to the Legislative Assembly. He strenuously opposed Brisbane as the capital, and endeavoured to have the seat of government moved to Gladstone. Walsh opposed plans for the first railway on the grounds that the colony was not yet wealthy enough and that outlying districts would be paying for the benefit of a favoured group in the south-east. In 1865 he was returned as the member for the new electorate of Maryborough. As fate would have it, in 1870 he became Secretary for Public Works in charge of railways. Walsh's administration of the railways brought him great credit. He carried through many reforms and was responsible for extensive reorganisation. In consequence of differences with his colleagues, he resigned from office on 10 July 1873. As reported by Bernays, Walsh was the only Speaker who ever used a gavel - `his irritable tapping of his desk with his little ivory mallet are familiar remembrances'. Unable to secure proper respect, he resigned suddenly on 20 July 1876. In 1878 he failed to win Logan and the following year was appointed to the Legislative Council. Walsh was appointed one of the Executive Commissioners for the Colonial and Indian Exhibition and spent a couple of years in London in 1885-86.  He died as a result of a tragic accident: he was run over by a hansom cab

            Additional Information
    Notes: Interests included the welfare of miners, hospital administration, child welfare and post- and ante-natal clinics. As a delegate to the 1910 Labor-in-Politics convention held in Townsville, he was successful in having the ALP adopt his proposal for the compensation of miners suffering phthisis. In 1916 the Ryan government passed the Industrial Diseases Act to cover such occupational maladies. In parliament the welfare of miners remained one of his major concerns. During the 1917 strike on the issue of compulsory unionism, he appeared before Justice McCawley, winning the case for the AWU. In 1921 and 1925 he supported miners striking against the Mount Morgan Mining Company, which intended to drastically cut their wages. He also lobbied for better mining education via the establishment of mining schools on the larger fields. He assisted in the establishment of a sanatorium for pulmonary sufferers at Westwood, near Rockhampton. Known affectionately throughout his life as 'Stoppy', he had a short, solid frame with a facial resemblance to Napoleon Bonaparte, and a wisp of hair hanging over his forehead. He was a witty speaker with an arresting gift of oratory. He was well known for his interesting and well-delivered speeches

      Additional Information
    Notes: At the age of 16, Mr Bedford 'humped his swag across the western plains of New South Wales', earning 6d. a rabbit skull, carrying copies of Carlyle's French Revolution, Shakespeare and the Bible. Mr Bedford worked as a freelance journalist and in 1896 in Melbourne he launched his mining and literary journal, the Clarian. Mr Bedford unsuccessfully stood as the Liberal candidate for the Victorian Legislative Assembly seats of Eastern Suburbs in 1897 (as an Independent Labor), West Bourke in 1900, and Bourke in 1906. Mr Bedford took his wife and family to England and Italy during the period 1901 to 1904. They then returned to Australia. Mr Bedford wrote a play White Australia, or the Empty North, and it was staged in Melbourne in 1909. He contributed articles during the period 1910 to 1912 to the Lone Hand on mining, shipping and the potential of the Mount Kosciusko area. He also wrote short stories for the Bulletin and he wrote another novel. By 1912, Mr Bedford and his wife had separated and in about 1915 he settled in Brisbane with Ada Billings. He resigned as the member for Warrego on 8 Sep 1937 to contest the federal seat of Maranoa. After his defeat at that election, he nominated as a candidate for the by-election for his old seat of Warrego and he was returned unopposed. In 1929 Mr Bedford was attacked by the government about his dealings in shares of Mt Isa Mines Ltd and its subsidiary. Other opposition members were also attacked, although Mr Bedford was the principal target. They made spirited refutation and rebuttal of the allegations. Mr Bedford obtained a withdrawal over an allegation that he gave away shares as a bribe for the construction of the railway. Mr Bedford was a formidable debater but he was impatient with parliamentary formalities and rebellious against party discipline so he was never elected to cabinet. In a speech Mr Bedford made on 6 Nov 1940 relating to liquor laws, he spoke against his own government on the policy by saying that the laws were against the interests of ordinary people. This attracted a verbal lashing in the chamber by the Premier, who stated that Mr Bedford did not speak on behalf of the government (his own party) nor on policy

    Notes: Bigge championed the early development of Cleveland and the push for Cleveland Point to become the major port of entry for Moreton Bay. This debate was lost to Brisbane when it was declared a warehousing port in 1849. He had a vision for Cleveland and was instrumental in building roads connecting Cleveland with Brisbane and Ipswich. While in the Legislative Council of New South Wales, Bigge supported the separation of Queensland from New South Wales

    Notes: The Archer brothers became renowned explorers and graziers who were responsible for opening up large tracts of land in Queensland. Charles and William discovered and named the Fitzroy River in 1853 and in 1854, with Colin, explored the Peak Downs district. The family partnership took up land in the Fitzroy valley and first occupied it in 1855. The city of Rockhampton now stands on part of the orginal `Gracemere' run. Gracemere homestead, built in 1858, remains in the ownership of the Archer family and is now listed by the National Trust. As a member of the Central Queensland Territorial Separation League, he renewed his fight for the separation of the central region. In 1890 he introduced a motion into the parliament to that effect but was defeated 34 votes to 19. The CQTSL sent Archibald and John Ferguson (a former Rockhampton member) to London to argue the cause, but they were unsuccessful. In September 1894, Archibald was appointed to a parliamentary committee which investigated the friction between the three railway commissioners. Its report recommended placing the department under one commissioner. Prior to Archibald's retirement from parliament in 1896, he had promised his constituents that the Winton railway extension would not be brought before the House during the session of 1895. However, the Nelson government successfully pushed the proposal through the parliament. Feeling betrayed, Archibald retired to London, where he died, unmarried

      Additional Information
    Notes: The financial crisis of 1865 saw RJ Smith withdraw from business pursuits. Directly after this, a more liberal administration of the land laws was required. The government sought and secured Smith's services, first as land agent and then as Commissioner for Lands, to carry out the provisions of the government's new land policy - an appointment which continued to his death. RJ Smith was a member of the Church of England and contributed largely to the building of St Paul's Church in Ipswich. He took a deep interest in the Ipswich Grammar School and became its Chairman of Trustees; President, Queensland Pastoral and Agricultural Society

      Additional Information
    Notes: Sunday School supervisor for 30 years and a member of the City Congregationalist Church. He never missed a day of parliamentary sitting, which was a record at the time. When campaigning, he would take a gramophone and a pile of records and play requests to attract and maintain a crowd. Although he did not drink, he used the Breakfast Creek Hotel as a meeting place during his campaign and visited it every day. Interests included tennis, swimming and motoring. Member, Ashfield Tennis Club

    Notes: As Premier, he took a strong stand against federal initiatives to take over the states' taxation role. By applying his political acumen, he managed to subtly change the Commonwealth's harsh financial recovery plan, all while retaining precious Commonwealth funding for Queensland. This action resulted in him being hailed as the saviour of Australia's then depressed economy. It was in the policy areas of agriculture (particularly sugar) and public works that Forgan Smith also made his mark. One long-term effect of Forgan Smith's premiership was to confirm the primary sector as the key component of the Queensland economy. Forgan Smith introduced an unemployment relief scheme under which relief workers were paid the basic wage and given a share in available employment, allowing numerous minor works to be undertaken. This was replaced in 1938 by a program of public works under which a number of significant projects were carried out across Queensland. These major public works included the Story Bridge; the Somerset Dam; the Grey Street Bridge; the Mackay Outer Harbour; the Hornibrook Highway; and the new university at St Lucia. He also established the State Electricity Commission. Cabinet stability was a hallmark of his premiership with only 6 changes of personnel occurring from 1932 to 1942, and his leadership was never challenged. It came as a surprise when news broke in September 1942 that he had informed cabinet the previous day of his intention to resign as Premier forthwith. Rumours flared that he would take a federal position, perhaps as High Commissioner in London. Instead he remained in the succeeding Cooper cabinet as Minister without Office until 9 Dec, when he resigned his seat to take up the post of Deputy Chairman of the Sugar Board (Chairman from 1944) and Chairman of the Central Sugar Cane Prices Board (until 1952). Forgan Smith was a keen golfer, lawn bowler and angler as well as an avid cricket fan. Forgan Smith was the recipient of an honorary doctorate of laws from the University of Queensland in 1935. He was made Chancellor of the University in 1944 and remained so until his death in 1953. He was given a state funeral on 28 Sep 1953 at St Andrew's Presbyterian Church, Brisbane

    Notes: He had a  strong association with the sugar industry in Queensland. He was a champion of local interests ; After reading George Dalrymple's reports of his exploration of the northern rivers, Fitzgerald organised an expedition to explore the river systems from the Daintree area down to the Johnstone. In 1880, with backing from the Catholic Church, he estabilshed a settlement which was to become Innisfail.  However, from the beginning, his new sugar venture was beset by problems. In 1885 he surrendered his interest in the venture

    Notes: Mary arrived in Brisbane with her parents from Ireland, in 1863.  After their marriage Thomas and Mary resided in Brisbane. Thomas was a follower of Sir Samuel Griffith .  On 4 August 1885 the then Premier, Samuel Griffith, moved - `That the seat of Thomas Campbell hath become and is now vacant, by reason of the insolvency of the said Thomas Campbell since his election and return to serve in this House as one of the members for the electoral district of Cook.' The question was put and passed. An article in the Gympie Times on 10 November 1885 said that Thomas was `a fine scholar and a man of great natural ability and application - as is shown by the fact that whilst fulfilling his responsible scholastic duties, he, quite unaided, managed to qualify himself for admission to the bar'. Brendan Garner, a relative of Thomas  has supplied additional family history to include in this biographical record

            Additional Information
    Notes: In the eight years that he was Minister for Justice and Attorney-General he acted to ease the backlog of cases in Queensland courts. He also oversaw the establishment of the Queensland Law Reform Commission and the Legal Aid Bureau. He introduced weekend detention and work release schemes for minor offenders, and by persuading the government to begin an extensive building program he significantly alleviated prison overcrowding. His reform of the state's drinking laws resulted in the provision of new types of liquor licences which allowed Brisbane hotels to remain open on Sundays and permitted women in public bars.  Sir Peter introduced Queensland's first consumer protection laws

    Notes: Interests included cricket, tennis and surfing. Mr Bruce was one of Queensland's best amateur heavyweight boxers. Mr Bruce arrived in Queensland in 1902 and headed for Cloncurry, where he established a name for himself in the mining industry. He unsuccessfully contested the federal Senate seat for Queensland on 16 Dec 1922. Mr Bruce retired from state parliament due to ill-health. The Bruce Highway was named after Mr Henry Bruce, who opened the first section of the road in 1934 as then Minister for Public Works. Whilst Minister for Public Instruction, he arranged for a professional tennis coach, Mr D Cameron, to take over the training of the State School Tennis Team to improve their chances in interstate competitions. After announcing his retirement from federal parliament, he was due to give his final speech but collapsed a few hours beforehand from a heart attack at Parliament House, Canberra, on 30 Sep 1958. He was taken to hospital but died on 11 Oct 1958. A state funeral was held for him on 13 Oct 1958 at St Andrew's Church, Brisbane

    Notes: It was this religion which shaped his ideals that fuelled a life-long commitment to end the social, political and religious ineqalities of the period. He was a prominent leader of many campaigns - the abolition of payment of compulsory taxes to the Anglican Church; the repeal of the Corn Laws which artificially maintained high prices for the benefit of landowners; a less authoritarian British rule in India; support for the Union forces against the slave-owning Confederacy; and major reforms of the British parliamentary system. John Bright's connection to Queensland is through a most bizarre indicent in July 1869, when the constituents of Kennedy elected him as their representive. Bright never visited Australia in his lifetime and probably was unaware of his connection with the Queensland parliament. In the mid 1860s a strong separation movement had begun to dominate the politics of north and central Queensland. In the 1867 general election, because of dissatisfaction with local candidates and their commitment to pursue separation policies, a John Bright Committee was formed in Rockhampton.  Although the committee realised that John Bright, if elected, could not personally attend sittings of the Queensland parliament, it was felt that as a radical member of the House of Commons, he was better placed to present North Queensland separatist policies to the British government. At the 1867 election, John Bright only polled 17 votes. However, at an 1869 by-election for the Kennedy electorate, John Bright was overwhelmingly nominated as a candidate by the electors of Bowen who had formed a separation league. This was done as a protest vote because none of the other local candidates had bothered to visit them. John Bright was duly elected with a one-vote win over the local candidate, Michael Cunningham. John Bright, as the member for Kennedy, never presented himself to be sworn between July 1869 and July 1870. So after one year, as required by the colony's constitution, the seat was declared vacant and another by-election was called at which Rockhampton lawyer Edward MacDevitt was elected

    Notes: White annoyed his Quaker parents by enlisting briefly in the army. He joined Pikes Bank in Dublin, which was owned by an uncle. With financial help from his uncle he decided to migrate, and he arrived in Sydney in November 1840 on the Royal Consort. In 1844 to 1848 he managed Beaudesert station for his cousin JP Robinson. With another cousin, George Robinson, he bought Beaudesert Station in 1851. In 1855 he began building a stately townhouse at Manly, called `Lota' after his wife's home on the shores of Cork Harbour, Ireland. He resided there from 1863 until his death. A frequent visitor to Lota House in the 1860s was Sir George Bowen, who, like his host, was a keen fisherman. White gave Nindooinbah to his eldest son, Ernest, on his marriage to Annie Barker in 1867. With Ernest and his second son, Albert, as partners, he took over the lease of Bluff Downs near Charters Towers in 1872. By 1869 he held Tubber, Pimpama, Merry Jerry, Beaudesert, Nindooinbah, Tweed Heads and Moreton, which were all mainly cattle runs. He also owned town lands in Southport and Beenleigh. He was one of the largest holders of freehold land upon which Southport was built in the 1870s and he also played an important part in the establishment of Beenleigh. White was one of the first men approached by Governor Bowen when forming the first parliament. At the time, he declined Governor Bowen's offer, but soon after he accepted appointment. Whilst a member, he was distinguished for his unremitting discharge of his duties. Foundation member,  Queensland Club. After he resigned in August 1880, he withdrew from public life except for being a foundation member of the Bulimba Divisional Board, when that division comprised the districts of Wynnum, Balmoral, Coorparoo and Bulimba. Prominent member and staunch supporter of the Tingalpa Anglican Church, of which he was for many years a church warden.  In retirement he remained the dominant partner in a family company WD White & Sons, but began to lose heart when his wife died in 1877. He died at home on 11 August 1893

    Notes: Stephens's radical politics and advanced social and moral views encouraged him to buy the Moreton Bay Courier in May 1861. He supervised the paper for four years in which it was enlarged and became a daily. In 1864 the paper became known as the Brisbane Courier. In July 1868 he floated a company, became managing director but retired due to ill health in November 1873 and the paper was auctioned. When Brisbane was incorporated, he became an alderman for South Brisbane and advocated development of the area. He initiated the first bridge linking the north and south of the city. He served on a committee to establish waterworks and advocated building a town hall. In 1860 Stephens stood unsuccessfully for Toowoomba in the first parliament. His home, Cumbooquepa, in South Brisbane, is now the boarding section of Somerville House

      Additional Information
    Notes: Amhurst came from a wealthy family. His elder brother was a large proprietor and the member for West Norfolk. On leaving Oxford, Amhurst travelled overseas to Algeria, Norway and America for a year or two before being called to the Bar of the Inner Temple. The information of personal friends about sugar growing in Mackay lured Amhurst to Queensland. He arrived in Queensland in 1872 and purchased Foulden estate, a fine sugar property. Before Amhurst died he had been in bad health. Hoping that a change would be benefical to his health, he boarded the SS Bokhara to return to England. On 3 January, and while at sea, Amhurst passed away

    Notes: Chairman, University of Queensland Students Council. Member: Newman Society; Brisbane and South Coast Hospitals Board; Federated Clerks Union and Australian Workers Union; Lions Club; and Johnsonian Club. Patron and Life Member, Returned and Services League of Australia (South Brisbane branch). Vice-President, patron, member and honorary legal adviser for many sporting and charitable organisations. In Sep 1962 allegations of mismanagement were raised about the Queensland Police Force, particularly concerning public complaints and the lack of responsible action from the Police Commissioner. Mr Bennett weighed into the debate. A royal commission was called for and eventually granted. A royal commission into police corruption was held, particularly the issue of prostitution being conducted from the National Hotel. A report was tabled in April 1964. In March 1965 Bennett again raised issues of police matters and was subsequently suspended from the House for 5 days. A key witness to this inquiry, Shirley Brifman, was found dead in her flat 6 months after a TV interview in 1972. Colin Bennett also 'distinguished himself with his fists' on occasions - for instance, in Dec 1963 he punched Greg Kehoe (a former Labor member and defector to the QLP) in the mouth, breaking a tooth and splitting his lip. Kehoe broke a finger trying to retaliate. He contested the 1972 state election as an Independent after he was disendorsed by the ALP before the 1972 election. He frequently clashed with the controversial Tom Aikens - for instance, over an incident where Mr Aikens alleged that a 'peeved' Mr Bennett had let down four tyres of a car parked in his lot at the Inns of Court. Interests include swimming, tennis and gardening

            Additional Information
    Notes: As Secretary for Public Lands, Taylor administered his office from Toowoomba without regard for the public good. Huge areas of Cecil Plains were withheld from selection and sold off to Taylor himself in 1870. This action was one of the reasons he resigned and subsequently Lilley lost government. In 1869, Taylor bought 'Union House', which he renamed 'Clifford House' after his father's home village in Yorkshire. Clifford House became Taylor's private residence, having been built in 1860 as a residential club for squatters. He contested the seat of Drayton and Toowoomba in 1870 but was unsuccessful. He proved to be one of the most vigorous and obstructive of the squatting rearguard. He resigned in 1881 and contested the seat of Drayton and Toowoomba but was again unsuccessful. Director, of the Queensland Brewing Co., the Queensland Mercantile and Agency Co. and the Land Bank of Queensland. Trustee, Toowoomba School of Arts and a member of the Queensland Turf Club, the Royal Agricultural Society, the Queensland Club and the Brisbane Diocesan Synod.

      Additional Information
    Notes: He was an incisive speaker, a deep reader and thinker and a strong opponent of the introduction of Kanakas. He was a frequent contributor to the newspaper columns. Brookes was a musician who had gained proficiency with several instruments. For years he was organist of the Albert Street Wesleyan Church. Brookes will be remembered as an anti-Kanaka crusader. He was defeated in the 1867 elections, but objected to the Kanaka immigration in the local newspapers, at protest meetings and at campaign rallies for pro-Kanaka politicians. He was a principal witness before a select committee set up in 1869 and again in 1876. But his efforts were futile. Brookes narrowly escaped bankruptcy in 1869, and the struggle to rebuild his firm, Brookes & Foster, restricted his political activities for a decade. He sold out to Foster in 1882 which freed him up to devote his last years to politics. In 1882 when the McIlwraith government sought to replace Kanakas with indentured Indian coolies, Brookes won a by-election in North Brisbane. For the next two years Brookes and the abolitionist Liberals pressed for a final solution to the Kanaka question. When Griffith recanted and extended the immigration of Kanakas in 1892, Brookes, in a memorable gesture, was carried from his sickbed to the Legislative Council. Too weak to stand, he spoke movingly for over an hour against the Kanaka traffic, emphasising his remarks by pounding the floor with a stick until he collapsed

            Additional Information
    Notes: Chairman, Plane Creek Mill Suppliers' Committee; Member: Mackay District Cane Growers' Executive and Mackay Cane Prices Board. A dispute between the Minister for Lands (Mr Walsh) and the President of the Court (Mr WL Payne) came to the notice of Parliament on 20 October 1942. Mr Walsh made a lengthy ministerial statement about remarks made in a judgement delivered by Mr Payne on 13 October 1942 relating to a boundary dispute in the Monto district. It resulted in a motion against the minister and a lengthy debate ensued. On 31 October 1944, Mr Walsh (Minister for Transport) and the Independent member for Mundingburra (Mr Aikens) engaged in fisticuffs in the lobby of the Assembly. Both members were ordered to attend at the Bar of the House, each to answer the charge of having created a disturbance. Both members tendered their apologies to the House. Mr Walsh supported Mr VC Gair in the split in the ALP and he was expelled from the ALP on 4 May 1957. Mr Walsh joined the new Queensland Labor Party and was re-elected to parliament in August 1957. He won the 1960 election by only 16 votes. In 1962 he refused to support the amalgamation of the QLP with the Democratic Labor Party. Mr Walsh's recipe for longevity was: 'Mow your own lawn, eat T-bone steaks and adulterate the milk - and a drop of Bundy is the only way to do that'

      Additional Information
    Notes: Browne, worried by the colony's precarious finances, voted for delay in building the new Parliament House, and he had little sympathy with the squatters and their constant pleas for financial help. In 1873, Browne formed the Brisbane Newspaper Co. with Gresley Lukin and W. Thornton and bought the Brisbane Courier and the Queenslander for £15,000. Lukin was editor and managing director from 1873 to 1880, when his insolvency led to a personal attack on Browne, which Browne successfully defended in the Legislative Council. Browne retained his share until 1886

      Additional Information
    Notes: He was active in local affairs, including the separation of Queensland. In June 1867 he was declared insolvent himself. He tended his resignation as Auditor-General to Premier Macalister but the letter of resignation was returned to him; New Premier Mackenzie suggested to Buckley that the previous letter of resignation be placed before parliament. Treasurer Stephens was assured that it was a fresh resignation so it was accepted. Buckley petitioned against this decision. A select committee on his petition found that no absolute resignation was given, so he was illegally deprived of the office of Auditor-General. The report was rejected by parliament on 15 July 1869. A select committee inquired into the management of the Auditor-General's department. It found that he had carried out his duties with ability and in a zealous and faithful manner; The committee unsuccessfully recommended that his services should not be overlooked and that his claims for re-employment should be considered
