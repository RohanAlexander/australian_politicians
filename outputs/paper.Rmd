# Introduction

We tidy and link two datasets about Australian federal-level politics from 1901 to 2020: biographical information and election results. Tidying and linking these datasets allows researchers to answer a variety of questions that each individual dataset cannot. Our datasets were created in a reproducible way that can be updated and corrected as necessary and form a resource of interest to a variety of academic disciplines.

Our biographical dataset - AustralianPoliticians - consists of a collection of datasets related to Australian federal politicians from 1901 through to 2020. The datasets are:

* 'all.csv': The main dataset. 
* 'by_division_mps.csv': Adds information about the division ('seat') of the politician. 
* 'by_party.csv': Adds information about the party of the politician. 
* 'by_state_senators.csv': Adds information about the state that a senator was representing.
* 'cabinet.csv': A dataset of who was in the cabinet.
* 'ministry.csv'**': A dataset of who was in the ministry
* 'uniqueID_to_aphID.csv': A correspondence between the uniqueIDs used in these datasets and the IDs used by the Australian Parliament House.

Our elections dataset - AustralianElections - consists of a collection of datasets related to all Federal Australian elections and by-elections from 1901 through to 2020. The datasets are:

* TBD.

Understanding who is, and has been, in parliament is a critical initial step for almost any type of quantitative analysis. Nonetheless, there is no publicly available comprehensive dataset of those who have been members of Australia's federal, state, and colonial parliaments. In this paper we introduce a new dataset - AustralianPoliticians - which contains daily data on the members of parliament for the Australian State Parliament, the six state parliaments, the two territory parliaments, and the preceeding colonial parliaments. We discuss the creation of this dataset, and then show its validity through various existing datasets and internal consistency tests. Finally, we discuss some extensions to this dataset. This dataset will be of use to those interested in quantitative analysis of Australian politics.


A critical first step for modern quantitative political analysis is a publicly available, comprehensive, dataset. In this paper we introduce one such dataset - AustralianPoliticians - which documents everyone who has been a member of any Australian federal, state, and/or colonial parliament. By bringing together various sources in this way, researchers can use this dataset to answer critical questions related to representation. Researchers can also build extensions to this dataset that focus on their particular interest. 

AustralianPoliticians is a record of everyone who has been a member of the Australian State Parliament (starting from 1901), the six state parliaments as well as their colonial predecessors, and the two territories. There are X unique people in the dataset, and the core dataset - `all` - provides basic biographical information about them. Related datasets are linked to this core dataset by a `uniqueID`, and deal with parliament and house, party, division, ministries, and finally translate the uniqueID into various other IDs used by other sources.

The datasets are up-to-date as of 1 July 2020, and will be maintained and updated on a quarterly basis, by the author for the next five years. The latest version of the datasets are publicly available via GitHub, with an annual version lodged with the Australian Data Archive.

These datasets represent a critical contribution to Australian political science. It is expected that they will be widely built on and expanded and we look forward to working with other researchers in this process.



The datasets are up-to-date as of 31 January 2021.




# Dataset details

## all.csv
This is the main dataset and contains one row per politician, with columns: uniqueID, surname, allOtherNames, firstName, commonName, displayName, earlierOrLaterNames, title, gender, birthDate, birthYear, birthPlace, deathDate, member, senator, wikidataID, wikipedia, adb, and comments.

```{r}
head(AustralianPoliticians::all)
```

uniqueID is usually the surname of the politician and the year that they were born, e.g. Abbott1859. In certain cases this is not enough to uniquely identify them and then we add the first name, e.g. AndersonCharles1897 and AndersonGordon1897. In cases where there is punctuation in the surname, e.g. Ashley-Brown or O'Brien, this has been removed but capitalisation has been retained, so those would become AshleyBrown or OBrien, respectively. 

commonName is used to highlight the name that the politician tended to be known as e.g. Ted instead of Edward This is used in displayName which is a politicians surname and their common name (if they had one) or first name e.g. Abbott, Richard. In cases where this would not be unique, e.g. Francis Baker, an additional name has been added.

earlierOrLaterNames is mostly used to keep track of women changing their names at marriage. Similarly, title is mostly used to keep track of 'Dr', but both have been used inconsistently and should be only used sparingly.

Some politicians don't have a complete birth date, and instead only have a year of birth. In these cases their entry for birthDate will be empty, but they will have a birthYear. All death dates are complete, but in the case of one politician -- John William Croft -- this has been inputted, as the circumstances and timing (even year) of his death are unknown. birthPlace is mostly taken from WikiData, with a few updates. There are some issues that need to be addressed here.

member and senator are binary indicator variables used to signify whether the politician was in the lower or upper house. Most politicians are only in one or the other, but some were in both. One politician in the dataset was neither a senator nor an MP - Heather Elaine Hill. She remains in the dataset because she was elected to the senate, and the need for this dataset to exactly match the AustralianElections one), however her eligibility was challenged and her election was invalidated, so she was never a senator. 

adb is a link to the Australian Dictionary of Biography.


## by_division_mps.csv
This dataset adds information about the division ('seat') of the politician. One row per division-politician, with columns: uniqueID; mpsDivision; mpsState; mpsEnteredAtByElection; mpsFrom; mpsTo; mpsEndReason; mpsChangedSeat; and mpsComments.

```{r}
head(AustralianPoliticians::by_division_mps)
```

Certain divisions change name. Sometimes this is minor, for instance Kingsford-Smith to Kingsford Smith, and sometimes it is total. In all cases this is being treated as change in division -- the politician is treated as finishing with one division and moving to another -- but changedSeat can be used to identify these cases and adjust for them if necessary.

byElection is a binary indicator variable as to whether the politician was entering the seat following a by-election. 

changedSeat is a binary indicator variable as to whether the politician left a division because they were changing the division, as opposed to losing an election or retiring.


## by_party.csv
This dataset adds information about the party of the politician. One row per party-politician, with columns: uniqueID; partyAbbrev; partyName; partyFrom; partyTo; partyChangedName; partySimplifiedName; partySpecificDateInputted; and partyComments.

```{r}
head(AustralianPoliticians::by_party)
```

Party can be a little confusing in cases where a politician changed party. In general, in this dataset, the to/from dates are set-up so that when a politician is in parliament they will have the correct party. However the dataset should not be used to say anything about when they are out of parliament. For instance, some politicians lost their seat, changed party, and then regained a seat in parliament. The dataset does not know when they changed party while they were out of parliament, and it assumes that they changed party either at the same time that they lost their seat or at the same time as they re-gained a seat. Similarly, there are plenty of cases where a politician has ceased being a member after they leave parliament, for instance, Malcolm Fraser left the Liberals. Again, that is not reflected in the dataset.

Certain parties, such as the Nationals, changed their name at various points in time. This is included as a party change for people at that time in partyAbbreviationParlHandbook	and partyNameParlHandbook. However, partySimplified abstracts away from that.

Party name changes:

* The Country Party changed to the National Country Party on 3 May 1975 according to http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article110636121. It then changed from the National Country Party to the National Party of Australia on 17 October 1982 according to http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article116476081. And finally, it changed from the National Party of Australia to The Nationals on 11 October 2003 according to the party website.
* The Nick Xenophon Team changed to Centre Alliance on 10 April 2018, according to ABC news reports.


## by_state_senators.csv
This dataset adds information about the state that a senator was representing. The variables are: uniqueID; senatorsState; senatorsFrom; senatorsTo; senatorsEndReason; senatorsSec15Sel; and senatorsComments.

```{r}
head(AustralianPoliticians::by_state_senators)
```

This dataset is fairly similar to by_division_mps, expect that it also has senatorsSec15Sel This is a binary indicator variable and indicates whether the senator has been appointed rather than elected.



## uniqueID_to_aphID.csv
This dataset adds a correspondence between the unique identifiers used in these datasets and the identifier used by the Australian Parliament House on its website. the main issue with the APH identifier is that it is not clear who it is referring to without looking it up. Additionally, in certain cases it changes from time to time, and it is easy to accidently change the format by opening it in Excel.

```{r}
head(AustralianPoliticians::uniqueID_to_aphID)
```


## appointments.csv
This dataset adds the beginnings of a dataset about ministerial appointments. Don't use it yet.

```{r}
# head(AustralianPoliticians::positions)
```


## Sources

In the first instance, the Parliamentary Handbook was the main source of information. This was augmented with information from Wikipedia, the Australian Dictionary of Biography, and the Senate Biographies wherever possible. Limited information was obtained from other sources, such as state parliaments and newspapers (via Trove), and these have generally been specified in the comments. birthPlace is mostly from WikiData.

The uniqueID_to_aphID dataset was primarily drawn from a dataset put together by Patrick Leslie, and it was checked against a modern dataset from [Open Australia](https://github.com/openaustralia/openaustralia-parser/blob/master/data/people.csv), and Tim Sherratt's Historic Hansard records for the [Reps](http://historichansard.net/hofreps/people/) and [Senate](http://historichansard.net/senate/people/).



# Summary statistics


## Australia

There have been X people elected to the Australian Federal Parliament from when it was established in 1901 through to 1 July 2020. This includes X people who did not take their seat either because of death or a nullified election.




## Validity

### Internal consistency

There are a variety of internal consistency measures that the dataset passes. These include: not having more members on any day than there are seats in parliament; X; and Y.

### Existing datasets



# R Package

Although it is possible to directly read in the CSV datasets, for those that use R [@citeR] a wrapper R package has been developed. This package can be installed from GitHub and then the datasets read in.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("RohanAlexander/AustralianPoliticians")
library(tidyverse)

all <- AustralianPoliticians::all %>% as_tibble()
by_division_mps <- AustralianPoliticians::by_division_mps %>% as_tibble()
by_party <- AustralianPoliticians::by_party %>% as_tibble()
by_state_senators <- AustralianPoliticians::by_state_senators %>% as_tibble()
uniqueID_to_aphID <- AustralianPoliticians::uniqueID_to_aphID %>% as_tibble()
```

The datasets could then be merged using `left_join`:

```{r combinetables, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
all_individuals_with_their_division <- all %>% 
  left_join(by_division_mps, by = c("uniqueID"))
```



Monica Alexander has written a brief blog post where she uses the package to look at life expectency of Australian politicians:

# Discussion 




## Weaknesses and next steps

The dataset represents a foundation that can be built on. In particular, 


## Roadmap

* Add information about education.
* Add information about relationships, for instance father-son, etc.
* Add voting based on JFG's dataset.
